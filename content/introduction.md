title: introduction

I'm Ryazan, an average programmer and non-native English speaker (thanks to LLMs!). I've always struggled to stay focused on a single project, resulting in a vast cemetery of abandoned ideas, which makes me quite sad.

The purpose of this blog, and the persona I've created here, is to hold myself accountable. I aim to take as many projects as possible from inception to completion, learning a great deal along the way, and sharing those insights, all while safeguarding my personal privacy.

I will document my journey here, detailing my experiences and lessons learned. While it's possible no one will read this, I'll write as though there is a large audience. Ultimately, my goal is to consistently produce meaningful work and maintain my motivation.
